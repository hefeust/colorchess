# What is ColorChess ?

Colorchess is a colored chess plating tactical helper.

Its  goal is to colorize the board surface with a simple color code on each square to denote the pressions balance of both sides during game play or replay phases,

# How to play

Just be clicking on starting square then ending square to play the corresponding move.

Do not worry if you miss a square, as of wrong moves are not played, simply click again on a sequence "start then destination"  sqaures.

To play an available castming move, you want to move to king by two squares horizontally with respect to desired castling side.

** this work is strongly in progress: so en-passnat moves, promotion prompting and filty-moving are not yet available at the end of noomber 2020, so please be patient, as these rules will come in the future.**
