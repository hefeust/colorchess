## The author

Hi! I am Fran√ßois CORTES, an IT & web developper in Ronchin, Hauts-De-France.

I studied at University of Lille: Physics , IT  and Cognitive Sciences in the early 2000's.

By the way I worked in various french tech companies (retails, web agencies) and education.

Of course I like playing chess, also: swimming & trekking.
