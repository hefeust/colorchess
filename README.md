## What's this ?

ColorChess is intended to help you learning chess !
It colorizes the board tiles depending on sides pression balance on tiles.

It uses a colored gradient schema to do it. If we represent this gradient in a 4x4 matrix, it looks like :

    pressions|    0    |    1    |    2    |   3+
    ---------+---------+---------+---------+---------
        0    |  green  | more... |and more |  white
    ---------+---------+---------+---------+---------
        1    | more... |  yellow |   ...   |   ...
    ---------+---------+---------+---------+---------
        2    | & more  |   ...   | orange  |   ...
    ---------+---------+---------+---------+---------
        3+   | black   |   ...   |   ...   |   red

As of you can easily see what's happen !
